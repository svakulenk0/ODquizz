# Open Data Quizz Builder

Web-site for constructing Open Data (OD) Quizzes.

OD Quizz is a quiz featuring tables with official goverment statistics pulled out from the Open Data portals designed to motivate citizens participation, awareness and transparancy.


Goals: 

(1) provide easy access to and further encorage discovery, exploration and utilization of the goverment statistical data;

(2) crowdsourcing OD annotations for question answering (QA) from tables.


Method: gamification: game-with-a-purpose providing support for semi-automated quiz construction.
